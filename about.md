Thanks.

Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone, just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.

---- The Great Gatsby


After two years MEP engineer career in Djibouti, I am trying to be a Data Analyst. Due to bias in the job market, I have to fake resume, Claim some hypocritical experience with dummy corporation and cover up the experience I have, the experience that is not shining and worth to self-pride but the real grounded. I dirty my hands to earn life, and still, I write it here, in a place that HRs won't show up, with the language they don't know. Enjoy!

I have to say, in past years, I made mistakes, arrogant and missed lot of opportunities. As a college graduate, I was a factory boy, operating CNC machine in a furniture factory, playing with a few CAM mechanical codes. That not a good choice, but it's last decade's story. Countless graduates end in there, be kicked to some assembly line, finally become some kind manager they called, drunk under the table. Rot, decay, whatever you say. That not life I desired. Then I did Integrated wiring works, building area networks for communities. Not bad but really hard work. After that, I was trying to pass Master's qualification exam. I failed, in many times. There are always things that you can't just jump and get it. You only struggle on it and fail. Not give up, but fail still.  

In the last two years, as an MEP engineer,  I worked in friend's company in East Africa. A contractor, building the palace for president, contracting infrastructure construction for WFP. Africa may be the best place for losers because every Foreigner shining like a boss. It rude, like a coarse ruby without polished, just been throw out there unconcernedly. And when you step closer. It corrupts. In the end, people can make only two choices, to be addicted, or to leave. I leave.

Then, I received vocational training, faked resume, I tried to describe my story honestly but who care, for a month no one phoned me.  Business is business, right? There is no country for old men. I faked my story and my age, and finally get a job for coding in iOS for a start-up company. Sucks.

The story ends here. Life goes on. It seems still has opportunities left. Just be tough, and boldly go where no one has gone before.

I'll be part of this world.
